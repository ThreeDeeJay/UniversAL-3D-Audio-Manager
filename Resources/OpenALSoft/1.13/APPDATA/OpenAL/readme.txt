OpenAL Soft Binary Distribution

These binaries are provided as a convenience. Users and developers may use it so they can use OpenAL Soft without having to build it from source.

Note that it is still expected to install the OpenAL redistributable provided by Creative Labs (at http://openal.org/), as that will provide the "router" OpenAL32.dll that applications talk to, and may provide extra drivers for the user's hardware. It will also provide 64-bit DLLs. The DLL provided here will simply add additional devices for applications to select from. If you do not wish to use the redistributable, then simply rename soft_oal.dll to OpenAL32.dll.. just be aware this will prevent other system-installed OpenAL implementations from working.

To use it, copy the DLL from the Win32 folder to the folder OpenAL32.dll is installed in.
For 32-bit Windows, the Win32 DLL will typically go into the system32 folder.
For 64-bit Windows, the Win32 DLL will typically go into the SysWOW64 folder. There is no Win64 DLL provided at this time.

The included openal-info.exe program can be used to tell if the OpenAL Soft DLL is being detected. It should be run from a command shell, as the program will exit as soon as it's done printing information. OpenAL Soft's default playback device will be "DirectSound Default", and others will have "via DirectSound" appended to them.

Have fun!
